title: Seven Attitudes of Mindfulness
---

1. Non-judging: cultivating the stance of being an impartial witness to whatever we are experiencing, breaking out of the habitual categorizing and judging of experiences which locks us into automatic responses/ reactions.

2. Patience: a type of wisdom, recognizing that, at times, things must unfold at their own pace; letting go of the tendency to be impatient with ourselves, our efforts, etc.

3. Beginner's Mind: coming to each experience as if for the first time; freeing ourselves from preconceptions and biases so that we may see things in a new light and perceive new possibilities.

4. Trust: learning to have faith in ourselves and our own intuition, honoring our own feelings, our native wisdom; following our own path, not imitating some one else.

5. Non-Striving: non-doing, with the intention of creating space for simply being who we are, being with what is already here; realizing that, in meditation, the best way to achieve our goals is to back off from striving and focus on seeing and accepting things as they are, in the moment.

6. Acceptance: seeing and accepting things as they really are in the present, which reduces the energy drained by denying, suppressing, or resisting what is already here, thus reading and focusing our energies for positive change.

7. Letting Go: non-attachment, letting go of our investment in particular thoughts, feelings and experiences; not elevating one thing while rejecting another, but accepting whatever is here in the moment.
