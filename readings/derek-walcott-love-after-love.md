The time will come 

when, with elation, 

you will greet yourself arriving 

at your own door, in your own mirror, 

and each will smile at the other's welcome


and say, sit here. Eat.

You will love again the stranger who was your self.

Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart 

to itself, to the stranger who has loved you


all your life, whom you have ignored 

for another, who knows you by heart.

Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,


the photographs, the desperate notes, 

peel your own image from the mirror.

Sit. Feast on your life.
