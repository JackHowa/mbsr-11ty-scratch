Until one is committed there is always hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness.

Concerning all acts of initiative and creation, there is one elementary truth, the ignorance of which kills countless ideas and splendid plans:

the moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too.

All sorts of things occur to help that would never otherwise have occurred.

A whole stream of events issues from the decision, raising to one's favor all manner of unforeseen accidents and meetings and material assistance which no man could have dreamed would come his way.

Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it.

Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.
