The wind, one brilliant morning, came to me, heavy with jasmine.

"In exchange for the scent of all your roses, I will give you the scent of my jasmine."

"I have no roses.

All of the flowers of my garden are dead."

"Then I will take the withered petals, and the spotted leaves, and the water of your fountain."

And the wind left.

And I wept.

And I said,

"What have you done 

with the gardens 

that were entrusted 

to you?"
