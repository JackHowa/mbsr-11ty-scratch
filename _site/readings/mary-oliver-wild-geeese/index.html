<p>You do not have to be good.</p>
<p>You do not have to walk on your knees</p>
<p>for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting.</p>
<p>You only have to let the soft animal of your body love what it loves.</p>
<p>Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the world goes on.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain</p>
<p>are moving across the landscapes,</p>
<p>over the prairies and the deep trees,</p>
<p>the mountains and the rivers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,</p>
<p>are heading home again.</p>
<p>Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,</p>
<p>the world offers itself to your imagination,</p>
<p>calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting --</p>
<p>over and over announcing your place</p>
<p>in the family of things.</p>
