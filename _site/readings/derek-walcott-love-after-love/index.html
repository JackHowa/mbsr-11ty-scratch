<p>The time will come</p>
<p>when, with elation,</p>
<p>you will greet yourself arriving</p>
<p>at your own door, in your own mirror,</p>
<p>and each will smile at the other's welcome</p>
<p>and say, sit here. Eat.</p>
<p>You will love again the stranger who was your self.</p>
<p>Give wine. Give bread. Give back your heart</p>
<p>to itself, to the stranger who has loved you</p>
<p>all your life, whom you have ignored</p>
<p>for another, who knows you by heart.</p>
<p>Take down the love letters from the bookshelf,</p>
<p>the photographs, the desperate notes,</p>
<p>peel your own image from the mirror.</p>
<p>Sit. Feast on your life.</p>
