<h2>I</h2>
<p>I walk down the street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I fall in.</p>
<p>I am lost ...I am helpless.</p>
<p>It isn't my fault.</p>
<p>It takes forever to find a way out.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p>I walk down the same street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I pretend I don't see it.</p>
<p>I fall in again.</p>
<p>I can't believe I am in the same place.</p>
<p>But it isn't my fault.</p>
<p>It still takes a long time to get out.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>I walk down the same street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I see it is there.</p>
<p>I still fall in ... it's a habit.</p>
<p>My eyes are open.</p>
<p>I know where I am.</p>
<p>It is my fault.</p>
<p>I get out immediately.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p>I walk down the same street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I walk around it.</p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p>I walk down another street.</p>
