<p>Two kinds of Intelligence</p>
<p>There are two kinds of intelligence: One acquired, as a child from school memorizes facts and concepts from books and from what the teacher says, collecting information from the traditional sciences as well as from the new sciences.</p>
<p>With such intelligence you rise in the world.</p>
<p>You get ranked ahead or behind others in regard to your competence in retaining information. You stroll with this intelligence in and out of fields of knowledge, getting always more marks on your preserving tablets.</p>
<p>There is another kind of tablet, one already completed and preserved inside you.</p>
<p>A spring overflowing its springbox. A freshness in the center of the chest. This other intelligence does not turn yellow or stagnate. It's fluid and it doesn't move from outside to inside through the conduits of plumbing-learning.</p>
<p>This second knowing is a fountainhead from within you, moving out.</p>
