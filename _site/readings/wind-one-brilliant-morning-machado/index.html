<p>The wind, one brilliant morning, came to me, heavy with jasmine.</p>
<p>&quot;In exchange for the scent of all your roses, I will give you the scent of my jasmine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I have no roses.</p>
<p>All of the flowers of my garden are dead.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Then I will take the withered petals, and the spotted leaves, and the water of your fountain.&quot;</p>
<p>And the wind left.</p>
<p>And I wept.</p>
<p>And I said,</p>
<p>&quot;What have you done</p>
<p>with the gardens</p>
<p>that were entrusted</p>
<p>to you?&quot;</p>
